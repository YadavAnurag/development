1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,500
What is this place?

1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,500
Who put us here?

1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,000
We don't know.

1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,100
What if we were sent here
for a reason?

1
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,200
You're so close to the truth.

1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,000
Don't you want to know 
why this all happened?

1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Three years we've spent behind
walls trying to break out.

1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,000
And now you wanna
break back in.

1
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,500
I get shotgun.

1
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,000
You can't save everyone Thomas.

1
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,000
I can try.

1
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
Jump!

1
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,500
When the hell does it stop?
It stops when we find the cure.

1
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,300
There is no cure!

1
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,400
Hang on!

1
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,500
Thomas, you can save your friends,

1
00:00:056,500 --> 00:00:58,700
or you can save us all.
