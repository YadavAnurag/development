Are you awake, mama?

00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:53,686
Good morning, angel.

10
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:56,096
How did you sleep?

11
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:57,755
Not very well.

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,950
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,377
You ready?

14
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:04,778
How do you feel?

15
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:06,159
Not the best.

16
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,292
Slowly. You want some tea?

17
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:28,218
Gorky

18
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,285
Squeeze my hand.

19
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:55,347
Good.

20
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:10,081
Coffee, please.

21
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:21,878
- Hallo.
- You're late.

22
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:22,907
Are you in a rush?

23
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:24,788
Always, I am a busy woman.

24
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,369
Toi, toi my darling.

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,797
- You should be back at 10pm.
- OK.

26
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:32,329
- Hello, Leni.
- Hello my beauty.

27
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,113
Tonight you are the proud of Russia.

28
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:12,033
I'm presenting my niece, Dominik Egorova.

29
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:14,858
Dmitry Ustinov, a value trend to the art

30
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,879
If there is ever anything I can do
for you, don't hesitate me to ask.

31
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,441
May be we have a photo?

32
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:23,558
Yes

33
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:43,725
American!

34
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,381
American! don't shoot!

35
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,943
American!

36
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,916
- American!
- On your knees!

37
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,310
Did you hear anything?

38
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,421
As far as we know, they got away clean.

39
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:31,124
They will be at your apartment
by now. Anything sensitive?

40
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:34,060
I know. No. Of course not.

41
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:35,843
OK, you fly to
DC in the morning.

42
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:37,603
It'll be a sting,
but we'll get you out.

43
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:40,158
It doesn’t look like anyone
was actually killed but...

44
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:41,686
Washington has questions.

45
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,192
So I got to ask.
What a fuck where you thinking?

46
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:46,233
I was protecting my ass

47
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,707
How that work out? He got away,
didn’t he?

48
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,800
Well, I guess you said it hear it for me

49
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:53,001
Those guys in the park...

50
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:55,938
the word is, they were vice cops,
and come for Chechnya dealers

51
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:59,052
as some family guy getting a
blow job in the bushes.

52
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,661
They weren't there for Marble.
They just got lucky.

53
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:04,839
The Chances are they were question to you,
and here we go.

54
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:10,220
But You can pay your ass they
are looking for now

55
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:21,060
They are expecting you, Deputy Director.

56
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,302
Thank you.

57
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,649
There are bold news about your niece.

58
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:31,981
I trust she is recovering?

59
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:33,888
She is in surgery now.

60
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,917
But... the prognosis for
her legs is not good.

61
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:39,092
Sorry to hear that. Drink?

62
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:41,628
It depends, what's the occasion?

63
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,298
I think you want one.

64
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:48,885
There was an incident Last night,
at Gorky Park.

65
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:52,412
Undercover Narcotics Agents saw
what they thought,

66
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:56,044
was a drug deal... and crosses,

67
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:59,019
when they mold in to question this man.

68
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:02,084
The other man fired his weapon.

69
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,970
Clearly attempt to distraction.

70
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:07,235
Now we know his name is Nate Nash.

71
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,435
He’s an official counselor
but he's a CIA.

72
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:15,431
He left the country this morning
on a diplomatic passport.

73
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:16,459
On the other...

74
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:18,335
the man he was meeting

75
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,690
does not panic, does not run.

76
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:22,746
He simply walks away.

77
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,482
My question is.

78
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:28,761
Who is he?

79
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:48,417
Your uncle Vanya has come
to visit the invalids.

80
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,544
You look well.

81
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,826
The Doctor said you wont
be able to walk for months.

82
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,552
Doctors don’t know everything.

83
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,153
No, They don’t.

84
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:00,985
I'll make some tea.

85
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,843
Let me help.

86
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,704
I'm glad my brother is in jail to
see what that clumsy fool did to you.

87
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:16,888
It would have broken his heart.

88
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:18,259
It was an accident.

89
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:23,340
Are you smoking?

90
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,387
I can smell it on you.

91
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,021
Why not?

92
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,985
I heard they already have ...a... have a
replacement for you at the company.

93
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:34,982
This girl named Sonja.

94
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,371
Obviously she is good.

95
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:40,622
Not as good as you, but
with time she can learn.

96
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:43,710
Have you read the reviews?

97
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:45,349
Competitive as you are.

98
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,259
Have you come to comesorate, uncle?

99
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,932
No, I have come to help.

100
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:52,988
Tell me, this apartment...
it belongs to Bolshoi, right?

101
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:55,577
How long you think they will
allow you to stay here

102
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,722
now they know you're not longer
a part of the company?

103
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,199
Three months? Six months?
If they are generous.

104
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:03,315
What about medical coverage
for your mother?

105
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,819
- They pay that as well, right?
- Yes.

106
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,273
Does she know?

107
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:08,873
She I’s not stupid.

108
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:10,094
Of course not.

109
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:13,753
And I know I haven't been around
as much since my brother died.

110
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:16,774
But... I'm here now.

111
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,637
And I want to help you.

112
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:22,997
So come see me when you're ready, please.

113
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,763
I have something for you.

114
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,697
You know, Dominika,

115
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,627
there are no accidents.

116
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,521
We create our own faith.

117
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,584
Sonja?

118
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,030
Hi.

119
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:01,101
How are you?

120
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:02,234
What is it?

121
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,952
I'm scared.

122
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:08,648
I went to see her at the hospital.

123
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,225
The way she looked at me. She knows...

124
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:12,949
She doesn't know.

125
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:16,024
What we have done is a sin.

126
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:18,761
They have always favored her.

127
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:21,953
No one else got the chance.
Is that fair? _

128
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,453
Isn't that a sin?

129
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:30,371
Good, I think it's enough for tonight.

130
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,346
Get some rest.

131
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,241
For 3 minutes.

132
00:15:22,777 --> 00:15:25,316
There has been an accident
at the Bolshoi Theater.

133
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,937
Women's locker room. Please hurry.

134
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,246
Honey?

135
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,796
Mom?

136
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:46,940
Mama?

137
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,620
What... What happened?

138
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,810
Nobody there.

139
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:55,736
Where's Leni?

140
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:59,018
The Bolshoi said they wouldn't pay anymore.

141
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,754
I am going to take care of us.

142
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:06,251
I am going to take care of us.

143
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,802
You could have come to my office.
It's cold outside.

144
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:22,099
Not yet.

145
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:24,239
You broke her jaw.

146
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,405
You've always had a temper, haven’t you?

147
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:30,606
You said you could help us.

148
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,357
If you help me.

149
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,436
So... what do you want me to do?

150
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,189
National Security is interested in knowing
more about Dmitry Ustinov.

151
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:44,345
You met him at he Bolshoi.
Do you remember?

152
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:46,948
He likes you.

153
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,786
A broken bird that he could help.

154
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,682
Something is legal he
wont be able to resist.

155
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,748
So, in a few weeks,
when your leg is better,

156
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:54,583
I want you to get to know him.

157
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,737
And get close to him and win
his trust.

158
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,135
How do you propose I win his trust?

159
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:02,332
You always know how to put on a show.

160
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:03,396
Find someone else.

161
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,693
Have you ever seen
state on hospital?

162
00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:10,264
Rats in the hallways.
Patients lying in their own waste.

163
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,580
If you do this, Dominika,

164
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:15,068
I will make sure, your mother
can keep her Doctors.

165
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,532
And I will make sure you can stay in
your apartment.

166
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:20,645
But only if I can show you,
can be a value to the state.

167
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,169
One night. That's all I'm asking.

168
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:27,946
Do this for your mother, Dominika.

169
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:33,760
He has dinner at the Hotel Andarja
every Friday at 9,

170
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:38,502
The car will arrive and you're a
part with to bring it to the hotel.

171
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:40,650
And you carry nothing with you.

172
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,462
We will arrange a room and
something for you to wear.

173
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,441
Make yourself presentable

174
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:51,946
Wear you hair the way you
wear at night at the Bolshoi

175
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:55,293
Let him see, just sit at the bar.

176
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,813
He sits at the same table
overlooking the restaurant.

177
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,724
You will stand out from the sort of
women who tend to go there.

178
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:04,221
I'm certain he will initiate contact.

179
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:05,784
And just do what he asks.

180
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:09,278
Ans when he drops his guard, I want you
to replace his phone with a duplicate

181
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,144
I'll make sure you're safe.

182
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,280
- A glass of Champagne. Please.
- Surely.

183
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,857
Dominika Egorova?

184
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,057
What a pleasure. May I join you?

185
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,879
Actually I am waiting for a friend.

186
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,316
Then I'll keep you company while you wait

187
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:54,755
Please.

188
00:18:58,248 --> 00:18:59,478
Terrible what happened to you.

189
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:00,994
Just bad luck

190
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,364
I don't think you believe that

191
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:06,688
My father joint himself to death at the age
of 43 and left us with nothing.

192
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:10,767
Now I could buy this place
and anyone in it.

193
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:11,800
Is that luck?

194
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:16,534
Do you think anyone born in my
situation could have done this thing?

195
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:19,155
There is no such thing as luck.

196
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:21,563
Just like you being here.

197
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:24,280
There is no friend, is there?

198
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:29,545
Tell me the real reason you are here?

199
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:41,543
I came to see you.

200
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,150
And what is it you want from me?

201
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:47,005
All I ever wanted was to be a dancer.

202
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,031
Ever since I was a small child

203
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,643
now I take the bus to the
rehearsal after school

204
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,260
and I would look out the windows at
the people going about their lives

205
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:02,045
going to work, half-asleep,

206
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,555
and I will tell myself

207
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:06,367
I'm not like them,

208
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,624
and I never will be.

209
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:11,615
Because I'm special.

210
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,123
I want to be special again.

211
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:42,731
Beautiful room.

212
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:45,354
I'm surprised you can afford it.

213
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,517
Will you excuse me for just a moment.

214
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:51,125
Of course.

215
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:23,926
Can we be alone?

216
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:39,184
Take off your dress.

217
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:52,295
Take off your dress.

218
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:18,444
Come here.

219
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:37,751
Cracking the vase.

220
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:41,607
True value comes
from the smallest imperfection.

221
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,428
A refining detail

222
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,780
That's what makes it a worthy collection.

223
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:06,404
Slow down.

224
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:14,442
Slowly. Slow down.

225
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:15,577
No no!

226
00:23:16,022 --> 00:23:17,022
Slowly!

227
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:18,910
Slowly

228
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:34,885
Hey... Hey, you!

229
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,732
How did this happen?

230
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:50,808
Ustinov dismissed the security
so I saw no opportunity, and they took it.

231
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,867
Why would he do that?

232
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:56,359
She asked him too.

233
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:01,916
She could be useful.

234
00:26:02,357 --> 00:26:03,566
She is a witness.

235
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:04,914
Get rid of her.

236
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:06,784
I trust at discretion.

237
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:11,597
If I be you, I would be very sure.

238
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:19,485
With doubts?

239
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:21,945
Yes

240
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:29,613
shame.

241
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:52,236
You knew what would happen once I
got in that room, didn't you?

242
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:55,013
You wouldn't have gone if I told
you what would have to happen.

243
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:56,569
I wouldn't have a choice

244
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:57,864
You knew what I do.

245
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,868
You came to me. That was your choice.

246
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,193
You are my uncle.

247
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:06,483
I would never have let him hurt you.

248
00:27:06,651 --> 00:27:08,211
He was inside me.

249
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:13,112
And I want to die.

250
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:14,804
You don't have to.

251
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:18,113
There is another life
for you if you want it.

252
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:20,393
You have potential, great potential.

253
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:23,548
You did well to get him alone

254
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:26,014
but what you said in that
bar was exactly right.

255
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:28,973
Because you told him exactly
what he needed to hear.

256
00:27:29,146 --> 00:27:32,757
There is a program that can teach
you everything you need to know.

257
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:34,757
It's training is very hard.

258
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:36,916
Only a few make it.

259
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,845
You know how to survive.
That's why I chose you.

260
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,525
Unless I'm wrong.

261
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:46,815
Perhaps you don't like to have my word,
perhaps you disapprove.

262
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,457
In that case

263
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:52,241
your future will be out of my hands.

264
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,107
I'm sorry.

265
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,286
Good morning, Mama.

266
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,992
What is it?

267
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:17,993
I have to go away for a while.

268
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:20,233
Leni will come to stay.

269
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:25,386
Is this something that
your uncle arranged.

270
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:27,752
I'll take care of us now.

271
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:29,528
You don't have to do this.

272
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:32,370
It's too late for that now.

273
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,135
Oh, no. What have you done?

274
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:36,377
I'm sorry.

275
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,526
I warned you about him.

276
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:42,622
The way he looked at you as a child.

277
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:43,943
Oh... Mom.

278
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,518
I tried to keep him away.

279
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:50,040
I tried to protect you.

280
00:28:50,823 --> 00:28:52,536
You hold something back.

281
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:55,497
Don't give him all of you.

282
00:28:57,512 --> 00:28:59,380
That is how we survive.

283
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:00,720
Yes, Mama.

284
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:09,849
Welcome to the State School 4.

285
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:12,286
You will know me as major.

286
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,778
Inside you will find the name you will use
during the train.

287
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,703
Under no circumstances we will reveal
your true name,

288
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:22,310
or any personal information
to cadet or member of staff.

289
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:24,896
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

290
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,067
Good

291
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:27,716
I show you to your room.

292
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,774
You are not like our usual recruits.

293
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:40,528
Most of them come from the
Military with some training already.

294
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,042
You will have to work hard to catch up.

295
00:29:43,277 --> 00:29:45,246
I will do as it is ask from me.

296
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:46,672
I am sure you will.

297
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:49,843
But someone like you does not enough here.
By choice....

298
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:54,258
Prima Ballerina who has an uncle in the SVR . [Foreign
Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation]

299
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,838
What is your crime?

300
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:59,519
Well, I suppose it doesn't matter

301
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,030
If you can not be of service to the state, I
am willing to pull a bullet through your head

302
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,241
The Cold War did not end

303
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,370
and shattered into a
thousand dangerous species

304
00:30:12,948 --> 00:30:14,714
The Westerner grow weak.

305
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:17,685
Drunk on
shopping and social media.

306
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:21,309
Torn apart by hatred between the races

307
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,822
and as a result, the world is in chaos.

308
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,118
Only Russia

309
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:30,263
is willing to make the sacrifices
required for victory.

310
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:32,904
There to be peace, we must once again

311
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,877
we must please ourselves
at the head of nations.

312
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,756
From this day forward you will become
SPARROWS.

313
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,981
Weapons in a global struggle for power.

314
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:45,592
You have been selected for your beauty.

315
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,284
Because of your strength

316
00:30:49,396 --> 00:30:52,130
and then, in some cases because
of your vulnerability.

317
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:59,150
Katya, Viktor, come here, please.

318
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:08,364
Here we deal with
psychological manipulation.

319
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:12,171
You will be trained to determine
a targets weakness,

320
00:31:12,462 --> 00:31:15,097
to exploit that weakness
through deduction

321
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,039
and to extract information.

322
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:21,662
Take off your cloths.

323
00:31:27,348 --> 00:31:29,155
Your body belongs to the state.

324
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:34,046
Since your birth, the state nourished it,
now the state asks something in return.

325
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:42,431
You have to learn to
sacrifice for a higher purpose.

326
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:46,355
To push yourself beyond
all the limitations.

327
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:49,992
And forget the sentimental morality
with which you have arisen.

328
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:52,671
Or is it pride?

329
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:57,348
In my experience, the proud
will be the first to fall.

330
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:04,207
Victor, take on your cloths.

331
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:17,344
They ready for you.

332
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:20,874
That is the recommendation on this panel

333
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:24,631
that you will be suspended indefinitely
from far assignment.

334
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,959
You'll be staying her in the States, Nate.

335
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:28,941
So... who is going to handle Marble?

336
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:30,986
That is no longer of your concern.

337
00:32:31,343 --> 00:32:32,347
Simone,

338
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:36,944
I've been with this guy for 3 years.

339
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:42,884
He is not going to deal with
anybody that he doesn't know

340
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:44,407
and doesn't trust

341
00:32:45,361 --> 00:32:48,907
like I said no longer your concern.

342
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:09,801
Gretel,

343
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,254
an invisible chemical compound
tailored to each subject.

344
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:18,091
Worn on the hands
after intimate contact.

345
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:21,481
The subject will be traceable
for up to 6 weeks.

346
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:32,306
Every human being is a puzzle of meat

347
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:34,530
You must learn to insured what is missing,

348
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:36,703
con man the missing piece

349
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,745
and they will give you anything.

350
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:45,258
This man is a diplomat at the Dutch Embassy
with access to NATO military planning.

351
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,065
6 years ago his marriage ended when the
police were called to his apartment

352
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,127
for the domestic disturbance

353
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:55,537
His wife accused him of improperly
touching their daughter.

354
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:58,995
Several nights a week he hires girls.

355
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,378
Runaways, addicts.

356
00:34:02,534 --> 00:34:05,060
What does he want?
He wants something rough.

357
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:08,224
He goes to Runaways
because they ca not call the police.

358
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,102
- No.
- You disagree?

359
00:34:10,346 --> 00:34:13,690
He wants a daughter, someone
to take care of ...and

360
00:34:14,616 --> 00:34:15,792
he will pay for it.

361
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:18,233
Very good, Katya.

362
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,053
He never touches the girls.

363
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:22,590
He buy's them dinner.

364
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:26,025
Next...

365
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:29,875
This man representative Juvashia in Parliament, he was the leading
critic of the President until he was arrested for indecency.

366
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:32,419
He was a leading critic of
the President until

367
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:34,114
he was arrested for indecency

368
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:38,747
What did he want?

369
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:40,816
He looks like a degenerate

370
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:44,020
by degenerate you
mean, a homosexual?

371
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:45,002
Yes.

372
00:34:45,198 --> 00:34:46,727
- correct, though

373
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:48,551
you're so judgmental

374
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:51,786
we all have our passions,
his happened to be around the young.

375
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,252
Anja, come here for a moment.

376
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:15,554
Here he is.

377
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:18,622
Give him what he wants.

378
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,512
What do you mean?

379
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:23,411
You called him degenerate?

380
00:35:23,804 --> 00:35:26,677
Therefore, he doesn’t want what's
between your legs.

381
00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:28,304
So... be a boy.

382
00:35:30,173 --> 00:35:31,592
On your knees.

383
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:39,401
Not the first time, I'm sure

384
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,324
must have been a boy in
the field behind your house.

385
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:44,523
A girl on a rainy bus station?

386
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:46,999
We like to think it makes a difference.

387
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,245
But it doesn’t.

388
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,751
It's just flesh.

389
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,698
I can't!

390
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:55,885
Yes, you can.

391
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:57,793
Tomorrow you'll try again.

392
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:00,851
And again the day after that.

393
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,538
You must enjoy yourself to
what you find repellent

394
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:14,425
find beauty in the human delusion

395
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:16,308
that the pleasures of the flesh

396
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:18,082
will make us whole again.

397
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,923
Even when the subject is repellant,
the body can be tricked.

398
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:37,445
Increasing fingers to the thigh

399
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,308
brings blood to the groin.

400
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:43,470
Manipulation of the nipple

401
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:47,840
leads to arousal.

402
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:54,651
Audio used... trigger

403
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,398
sexual desire.

404
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:00,771
But Physical manipulation is not enough.

405
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,966
You must learn to love on command.

406
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:08,293
What is it to be loved?

407
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:12,413
To be seen.

408
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,347
To be recognized.

409
00:37:16,588 --> 00:37:18,261
To feel no longer alone.

410
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:53,981
- When did you first notice the tail?
- Week ago

411
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:55,888
What do you make on that?

412
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:57,839
The Russians you still follow
me to follow me it means they

413
00:37:57,863 --> 00:38:00,599
are looking for amazing Marvel
stone out there. It's a lie.

414
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,425
As far as we know.

415
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,964
You gotta talk to him to him.

416
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:08,161
Marble refused all attempts at communication
of the last four and a half months

417
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:09,685
you work 'em out for me.

418
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:15,242
I know you can't get me in a rush into of this,
somewhere close somewhere in Eastern Europe.

419
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:18,094
SVR be on me right away.

420
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:21,486
Marvel kept word he's going to surface.

421
00:38:21,854 --> 00:38:23,383
Otherwise, this guarantee is,

422
00:38:23,408 --> 00:38:25,937
he is gonna stay silence.
Simon, you gotta send me back.

423
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:26,962
Alright.

424
00:38:27,148 --> 00:38:28,675
You got one assignment.

425
00:38:29,344 --> 00:38:30,563
You can contact him,

426
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:33,734
and you convince him to
work with another Officer

427
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:35,593
That'll be me.

428
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,914
Will be coming with you.

429
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,643
Would you have a problem with that?

430
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:40,029
No, no problem.

431
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:51,828
These soldiers have been deployed
overseas for almost a year.

432
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:57,122
Welcome them home.

433
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:18,468
Turn off the lights.

434
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:19,915
No rush.

435
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,258
What's your name?

436
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:23,077
Pyotr.

437
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:47,515
Do you have somebody home?

438
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:49,954
Someone you think about

439
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,511
Close your eyes.

440
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,599
Think about a face

441
00:40:03,174 --> 00:40:04,374
remember our smell

442
00:40:04,787 --> 00:40:06,056
the ancient

443
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:07,494
Welcome Mr.Dantes

444
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:10,791
sweet, sentimental maintaining control

445
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:14,024
but you chose a boy, touche.

446
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:17,337
Your choose of boy, so you would
not have to give yourself

447
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:19,838
wont always be, as he see

448
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:21,666
next!

449
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,410
Three days ago, Nash was
reassigned to Budapest.

450
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,653
I believe it is an attempt to
re-establish contact with the 'mole'.

451
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,966
We have friends in Budapest.

452
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:01,179
And then pick him up and...

453
00:41:01,496 --> 00:41:03,308
extract the
information directly.

454
00:41:03,396 --> 00:41:05,730
That means we have to
explain the President

455
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:09,012
why every Officer we have in Western
Europe is snatched in retaliation.

456
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,050
Vanya is correct.

457
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:15,319
The President will not condone anything but
antagonizes the Americans unnecessarily

458
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:19,290
Not yet.

459
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:21,633
But your propose is when?

460
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:24,727
Nash is a skilled Officer,
that night, in the park

461
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:26,767
he made a mistake

462
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:28,821
he reacted emotionally

463
00:41:29,664 --> 00:41:30,664
which tells me

464
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:33,066
he cares about the man

465
00:41:34,454 --> 00:41:37,425
I propose we give him
someone else to care about

466
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,189
You are accused of assaulting a fellow.

467
00:42:00,214 --> 00:42:01,835
He tried to rape me.

468
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:05,683
And your honor is worth to trying
Russia of a provincing contempt?

469
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:10,500
It was never my intention to
province Russia of anything.

470
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:12,351
And yet here we are.

471
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:14,684
Matron, what is your opinion?

472
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,328
Its only been three months,

473
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:19,038
but I believe Katya still
has potential.

474
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:22,061
I'd like to talk alone with the accused.

475
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:35,061
You did well with Ustinov in Moscow,

476
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:38,047
That's why you given this chance.

477
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:41,347
You where told what would happened
to you if your fail here?

478
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:42,575
Yes

479
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,183
so..why not let it happen?

480
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:45,742
I serve the state.

481
00:42:46,044 --> 00:42:47,456
I serve our President.

482
00:42:49,308 --> 00:42:51,034
I serve you, General.

483
00:42:52,223 --> 00:42:53,495
But I owe him anything.

484
00:42:54,212 --> 00:42:57,769
What sort of man would send his niece
to the State School Four?

485
00:42:58,385 --> 00:42:59,385
A patriot.

486
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:05,478
My wife and I saw you dance once.

487
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,476
That was the different life.

488
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:09,144
There are so many.

489
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:11,550
Don't you fine?

490
00:43:15,855 --> 00:43:16,855
You may go.

491
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:30,659
The sprouts must harden himself
against the weak and sentimental.

492
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:33,424
And see these things for what they are.

493
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:35,592
Selfishness.

494
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:41,474
Katya,

495
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:43,809
what does he want?

496
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:45,090
Come forward.

497
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:56,063
For the deception for being completely.

498
00:43:56,307 --> 00:43:57,895
You must hold nothing back.

499
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:00,202
Nothing... understand?

500
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:06,346
Give him what he wants.

501
00:44:15,626 --> 00:44:16,761
Well?

502
00:44:18,206 --> 00:44:19,206
Turn around!

503
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:20,417
No!

504
00:44:20,464 --> 00:44:21,797
I said, turn around.

505
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,580
Don't look at her.

506
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,872
I want to watch you do it.

507
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:38,794
Look at me!

508
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,308
Look at me.

509
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,605
I said, look at me.

510
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:06,797
Well?

511
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:15,786
What are you waiting for?

512
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:20,613
I'm ready.

513
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,247
Will you going to fuck me or not?

514
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:31,500
Nothing?

515
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:37,531
Shame.

516
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:39,555
Bitch!

517
00:45:43,385 --> 00:45:44,389
Power.

518
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,388
That what he wants.

519
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:49,401
Get dressed.

520
00:46:02,237 --> 00:46:04,579
There is a car waiting
to take you to Moscow.

521
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:08,396
I've done everything you asked of me.

522
00:46:08,522 --> 00:46:09,522
Don't contrary

523
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:12,129
you have done nothing I asked.

524
00:46:12,974 --> 00:46:15,107
But my superior think otherwise.

525
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,140
I suppose we will find out.

526
00:46:27,268 --> 00:46:28,268
Good bye

527
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:30,932
Dominika

528
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:41,318
Hallo mama.

529
00:46:48,168 --> 00:46:49,306
How are you?

530
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,396
I'm home.

531
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,807
My baby...

532
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:06,957
Hallo!

533
00:47:12,307 --> 00:47:13,307
Yes

534
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:19,982
they will never let you go.

535
00:47:21,768 --> 00:47:22,968
I will find a way.

536
00:47:36,146 --> 00:47:37,274
Welcome home.

537
00:47:38,307 --> 00:47:39,789
How are you?

538
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:40,962
Have a seat.

539
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:45,628
- What can I get you?
- I am not hungry.

540
00:47:46,274 --> 00:47:49,679
Oh... Come on, you used to love this
place when you were little.

541
00:47:50,071 --> 00:47:53,955
You've always been so serious with your
big grown-up eyes and your child's face.

542
00:47:54,026 --> 00:47:55,704
What do you want, uncle?

543
00:47:57,103 --> 00:47:59,666
There is a traitor hiding in
a place in the government.

544
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:02,095
Progeny one of the
intelligence agencies.

545
00:48:02,325 --> 00:48:03,628
A mole

546
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:07,477
His last contacts...

547
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:10,846
...is an American now in Budapest.

548
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:13,324
What I want from you is
to get close to him.

549
00:48:13,962 --> 00:48:15,517
And establish trust.

550
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:17,660
And then you bring me
the name of the mole.

551
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:19,847
You follow the trail whatever it needs.

552
00:48:20,014 --> 00:48:22,564
You'll Sacrifice whatever
needs to be sacrificed.

553
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:23,717
Do you understand?

554
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:25,982
Yes, uncle.

555
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:27,772
This is for you.

556
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,004
What is it?

557
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,573
New passport. Credentials.

558
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:36,960
New name, Katerina Zubkova.

559
00:48:37,897 --> 00:48:41,782
And what reward will they give you?

560
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,103
A promotion?

561
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:46,008
I understand you're angry with me.

562
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,849
You sent me to whore school.

563
00:48:49,213 --> 00:48:50,811
I made you special again.

564
00:48:51,066 --> 00:48:53,335
You have a gift, like me.

565
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:56,466
You see through people.
You see them for what they really are.

566
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:58,672
And you always stay one step ahead.

567
00:48:59,105 --> 00:49:01,850
If you do this for me and I'll let you go,
if that's what you want?

568
00:49:02,154 --> 00:49:03,820
But I feel you wont.

569
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:06,888
This is what you are meant to do.

570
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:09,263
Yes, uncle.

571
00:49:10,536 --> 00:49:11,953
Let's eat.

572
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:13,617
Excuse me.

573
00:49:15,324 --> 00:49:17,055
- Do you have everything?
- Yes sir.

574
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:18,665
How does that sound?

575
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,294
Welcome to Budapest.

576
00:50:09,996 --> 00:50:11,022
You must be Katerina?

577
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,246
Hallo

578
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:14,509
You are pretty.

579
00:50:19,787 --> 00:50:23,112
I'll show you to your room.
The bathroom is down the hall.

580
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,605
I'm I there, and you through there.

581
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:35,536
I keep my door locked. If I where
you I would do the same.

582
00:50:36,108 --> 00:50:39,322
Stay out of my way and I stay out of yours
and we should get along file.

583
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,638
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

584
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:45,377
I imagine, tomorrow you
meet our station Chief

585
00:50:46,892 --> 00:50:47,936
a Warning.

586
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:51,515
Chief Volontov never met an idea
he didn't want to take credit for

587
00:50:51,781 --> 00:50:54,234
and..he likes to try with the new girls

588
00:50:54,498 --> 00:50:56,763
when he is not drooling after strippers

589
00:50:57,645 --> 00:50:58,857
He is going to like you

590
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:00,036
Tell me about the American.

591
00:51:00,268 --> 00:51:01,984
He is not exactly a match fit

592
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,757
he swim’s every afternoon.

593
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:06,750
Works his time but...

594
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:09,055
he drinks to much

595
00:51:10,898 --> 00:51:12,664
he looks at pornography.

596
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,959
Nothing out of the ordinary

597
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:19,265
Anal, threesomes...

598
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:22,179
Usually two man on a girl.

599
00:51:24,968 --> 00:51:26,523
No relationships to speak of

600
00:51:26,845 --> 00:51:29,508
a few girls he has paid..couple
of times, but then he

601
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:31,243
Feels guilty and gives them tips.

602
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:36,618
Perhaps with the more successive
we knew what we were looking for.

603
00:51:37,116 --> 00:51:40,423
I am offering completely
cooperation of my office.

604
00:51:40,588 --> 00:51:43,015
And in exchange I hope to cuelt love

605
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:46,975
cube us in form of your progress.

606
00:51:48,035 --> 00:51:49,039
Of course.

607
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,054
You need a hand?

608
00:52:29,888 --> 00:52:30,969
No, it's all right.

609
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,497
You wanted to be good?

610
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,087
Let me help you.

611
00:52:34,953 --> 00:52:36,599
Come on, give it to me.

612
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,198
Every women being is a puzzle of meat.

613
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:49,378
Learn how to meet missing piece, and
they will give you everything.

614
00:52:53,824 --> 00:52:55,899
You thought you were the only one?

615
00:53:00,536 --> 00:53:02,852
We'll always be their whores.

616
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:11,675
Unless, of course, we
have something they want.

617
00:53:20,438 --> 00:53:22,440
If I where you I'd find something.

618
00:53:25,582 --> 00:53:27,393
The pool is open from 6 in the morning

619
00:53:27,418 --> 00:53:29,347
until 10 at night, from Monday to Friday.

620
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:32,277
From six to eight on weekends.

621
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:36,138
No personal belongings are allowed.

622
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,201
I made a mistake, sorry.

623
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:45,174
Handing your membership card here
for a local key.

624
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:47,253
You get your card back
when you return the key.

625
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:49,768
Any questions?

626
00:53:50,009 --> 00:53:51,009
No.

627
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:39,415
[speaking Russian]

628
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,111
How did you know I was a Russian?

629
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:45,310
It was just a guess.

630
00:54:47,943 --> 00:54:48,752
You speak well.

631
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:50,101
I used to live in Moscow.

632
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:51,455
Do you miss it?

633
00:54:52,309 --> 00:54:53,994
Yeah... you know... food and people.

634
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:55,736
What are you doing in Budapest?

635
00:54:55,761 --> 00:54:57,666
I'm a translator at the Embassy. You?

636
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:00,220
Commercial counselor. Medical supplies.

637
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:02,227
I've never seen you at any of the
Embassy events.

638
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:04,680
I haven't been here long.

639
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:06,650
Excuse me.

640
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,450
Blonde suits you better way.

641
00:55:17,892 --> 00:55:18,931
Have we met?

642
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,689
I thought I saw you at the pool
yesterday and on the tram, I think.

643
00:55:23,442 --> 00:55:24,789
You are mistaken.

644
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:29,518
Would you like to get
something to eat with me?

645
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:31,465
I know a Turkish place at the station.

646
00:55:31,552 --> 00:55:33,756
A shit hole, but the food is pretty good.

647
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:35,968
Maybe you know it.

648
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,369
I am not hungry.

649
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:39,464
Perhaps another time.

650
00:55:45,921 --> 00:55:47,572
See you in the pool. I guess.

651
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:23,045
Your ID is missing.

652
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,330
Are you sure?

653
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,779
Put it down my self.

654
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:32,066
Sorry, I'll have to make you a new one.

655
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,226
I've got your picture on file.

656
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:35,567
Take your time.

657
00:56:35,748 --> 00:56:40,096
She came in under
the name of Katerina Zubkova.

658
00:56:40,784 --> 00:56:42,896
Registered as a translator for the Embassy.

659
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:47,326
But her real name is Dominika Egorova.

660
00:56:48,165 --> 00:56:50,842
She use to dance with the Bolshoi.

661
00:56:51,222 --> 00:56:53,790
There is officially no record
of her being SVR.

662
00:56:53,845 --> 00:56:56,031
But that's bullshit.
She is here for Marble. And now...

663
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:58,222
- stay away from her.
- I think she is valuable.

664
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:00,318
- And now you think she is recruitable?
- Maybe.

665
00:57:00,342 --> 00:57:01,822
OK... that is not what you here for.

666
00:57:02,213 --> 00:57:03,835
Just keep doing what you doing

667
00:57:04,186 --> 00:57:05,186
Play dead.

668
00:57:05,241 --> 00:57:07,486
Let's take a sleep and pray
Marble sticks here again...

669
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:09,472
so we can get him back into place.
That's the priority.

670
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:11,790
She is Ivan Egovars niece.

671
00:57:16,876 --> 00:57:18,429
Deputy Director of the SVR?

672
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:20,227
I have nieces.

673
00:57:20,777 --> 00:57:23,829
Spend most of their times exposing
themselves on the internet

674
00:57:23,924 --> 00:57:25,290
Why would she use her real name?

675
00:57:25,315 --> 00:57:26,657
Because she is an innocent.

676
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,974
Or because it is a provocation

677
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:31,229
Both of witch are very good
reasons to stay away from her.

678
00:57:31,253 --> 00:57:33,988
There is something about this girl.
She is gold.

679
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:36,886
- I know it.
- OK.

680
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:39,340
See what you can find out.

681
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:42,423
- Thanks.
- Just go slow, okay?

682
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,381
- Nate!
- Ahm?

683
00:57:44,406 --> 00:57:47,104
If she does let you fuck her,
she is definitely SVR...

684
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:49,614
because she is way out of your league.

685
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:59,174
I need you to get me on a list for
an event at the American Embassy.

686
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:00,287
I can do that.

687
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:02,197
- Thank you.
- If...

688
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:04,782
you give me a progress report in return

689
00:58:05,668 --> 00:58:07,013
I established contact.

690
00:58:07,314 --> 00:58:08,318
Contact?

691
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:10,212
I thought you'd be on your back by now?

692
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:12,730
You know...

693
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,898
There are always stories about Sparrows.

694
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,979
Capable of performing
tricks on a man's mind.

695
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:22,831
Not to mention the rest of the body.

696
00:58:25,056 --> 00:58:26,516
A magic pussy.

697
00:58:26,722 --> 00:58:27,932
That's what they say.

698
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,500
Perhaps I'll find out.

699
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:36,883
Just a little fun.

700
00:58:38,687 --> 00:58:42,148
But the offer stands. If you need
help, Don't hesitate to ask.

701
00:58:43,113 --> 00:58:47,524
After all, everyone needs a friend.

702
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:50,572
The success of these efforts
will be critical... for securing

703
00:58:50,597 --> 00:58:52,877
Hungary economy and ties with
its neighbors.

704
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:55,949
This is clearly the moment of
rapid change in the world.

705
00:58:55,973 --> 00:58:59,377
Making it imperative for each
region to stay competitive.

706
00:58:59,943 --> 00:59:01,945
Thanks to the Hungarian President
for hosting us

707
00:59:02,157 --> 00:59:04,998
and the American Ambassador
to organize this.

708
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:09,227
Finally, I would like to thank my
Chief of Staff, Stephanie Boucher..

709
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:12,352
Without her hard work
we would not be here tonight.

710
00:59:13,894 --> 00:59:14,916
Stephanie.

711
00:59:36,521 --> 00:59:37,645
Dominika Egorova.

712
00:59:39,048 --> 00:59:40,500
You know my name?

713
00:59:41,033 --> 00:59:42,037
You told me.

714
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:45,361
You stole my ID from the pool.

715
00:59:46,531 --> 00:59:47,789
That would be illegal.

716
00:59:49,957 --> 00:59:51,372
Where you just looking for me?

717
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:53,333
I know where to find you. If I was.

718
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:56,593
I'm curious, Did you want me
to know you were following me,

719
00:59:56,658 --> 00:59:58,168
or are you just real clumsy?

720
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:01,475
You Americans always think the rest of
us is so interested in you, don't you.

721
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:04,057
What made you wanna become a translator?

722
01:00:04,658 --> 01:00:07,893
I'm sure if you know my name you
found out other things about me,

723
01:00:07,946 --> 01:00:10,729
I have wondered what it would be like
to pursue something your hole life,

724
01:00:10,753 --> 01:00:12,273
and then have it ripped away from me.

725
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:15,946
What is it like?

726
01:00:16,088 --> 01:00:17,518
How does it make you feel?

727
01:00:17,596 --> 01:00:18,728
It doesn't matter.

728
01:00:20,174 --> 01:00:24,333
My mother is unwell. If I work for the
government that still helps to take care of her.

729
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:27,096
My uncle helped me to get the job.

730
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:29,217
Your uncle is a very powerful man.

731
01:00:29,515 --> 01:00:32,847
In my country if you don't matter to
the man in power, you don't matter.

732
01:00:33,685 --> 01:00:35,328
Is that so different in your country?

733
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,660
It supposed to be, but...

734
01:00:39,211 --> 01:00:40,348
Are you a patriot?

735
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,488
No.

736
01:00:43,847 --> 01:00:45,070
Then why do you do what you do?

737
01:00:45,094 --> 01:00:46,528
Better than selling car tires

738
01:00:47,604 --> 01:00:48,982
Have you ever sold tires?

739
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,165
No.

740
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:52,294
Then you can not, can't you?

741
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,944
Good point.

742
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:58,474
Hey..ah..I would like to see you again.

743
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:00,818
Why? Are we going to become friends?

744
01:01:01,677 --> 01:01:02,857
Is that what you want?

745
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:04,929
I don't have any.

746
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:07,413
There is a Russian restaurant
right by the opera.

747
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,107
Have dinner with me there.

748
01:01:09,607 --> 01:01:10,881
Tomorrow at 8pm

749
01:01:32,577 --> 01:01:33,619
Marta?

750
01:02:47,158 --> 01:02:49,865
Senator Chief of Staff.
SWAN

751
01:02:55,086 --> 01:02:57,357
Initial Payment $ 250,000?

752
01:03:38,826 --> 01:03:39,830
Are you home?

753
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,018
That was him at the Embassy?

754
01:03:44,044 --> 01:03:45,044
It was

755
01:03:45,107 --> 01:03:46,509
playing hard to get, hurry up.

756
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,729
No substitute for a good, old-fashioned
blow job, in my experience.

757
01:03:50,972 --> 01:03:51,987
He is not like that.

758
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:57,967
What is this?

759
01:03:58,158 --> 01:04:00,998
A copy of the report that
Volontov sent to Moscow, three days ago.

760
01:04:01,105 --> 01:04:02,935
Apparently you have made an enemy.

761
01:04:20,386 --> 01:04:21,391
Good evening.

762
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:22,776
Good evening, sir.

763
01:04:46,828 --> 01:04:48,180
Is this a coincidence?

764
01:04:48,862 --> 01:04:51,535
You were right. I do need a friend.

765
01:04:53,341 --> 01:04:55,189
Everyone needs a friend.

766
01:04:57,944 --> 01:05:00,021
I need you to send a
report that you are

767
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:02,646
impressed about my progress
I've made with Nash.

768
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,920
I need more time.

769
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:07,466
And then, I would owe you.

770
01:05:09,962 --> 01:05:12,373
How do I know that you
are paying your debts?

771
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,177
You're right about Sparrows.

772
01:05:24,351 --> 01:05:26,040
We are special.

773
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,373
Do you know what they teach us?

774
01:05:28,915 --> 01:05:31,092
How to determine what a lover needs..

775
01:05:32,394 --> 01:05:36,178
And I knew what you needed from
the first time I ever saw you

776
01:05:38,089 --> 01:05:41,351
Someone who does not laugh
at your microscopic dick.

777
01:05:46,496 --> 01:05:47,606
Get your hands off me!

778
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:49,975
Take a look at the camera
over my left shoulder.

779
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,893
Tomorrow you write a favorable report,
or I let you arrest for sexual assault.

780
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:58,506
You will be recalled to Moscow
and your career will be over.

781
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,160
Good night.

782
01:06:42,997 --> 01:06:44,007
Hallo!

783
01:06:44,097 --> 01:06:47,297
<i>This is an automated test of your digital
phone line. Sorry for the interruption.</i>

784
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:51,203
<i>Alpha, Charlie, Zero, Whiskey.</i>

785
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:10,545
Vienna.

786
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,548
This is Dominika.

787
01:07:26,173 --> 01:07:27,177
Come on up.

788
01:07:34,944 --> 01:07:36,752
- Hey.
- Can I have a drink?

789
01:07:37,163 --> 01:07:38,167
Come on in.

790
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:41,728
Whiskey?

791
01:07:44,014 --> 01:07:45,018
Thank you.

792
01:07:52,924 --> 01:07:55,040
So... you wanna tell me what happened?

793
01:07:56,567 --> 01:07:59,419
My big boss's boss is insulted that I
don't want to sleep with him.

794
01:08:00,295 --> 01:08:01,682
What is his name?

795
01:08:03,002 --> 01:08:04,301
Maxim Volontov.

796
01:08:04,768 --> 01:08:06,175
- I've heard from him.

797
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,339
How did you know where I lived?

798
01:08:28,435 --> 01:08:29,968
Why did you leave Russia?

799
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:32,729
I screwed up at work.

800
01:08:35,065 --> 01:08:37,982
Why would a CIA Officer fire
his gun in a public park?

801
01:08:39,485 --> 01:08:41,195
I did it for a friend.

802
01:08:42,603 --> 01:08:45,854
Because I knew what
they would do to him.

803
01:08:46,465 --> 01:08:47,556
So do you.

804
01:09:04,571 --> 01:09:06,091
What do you want, Dominik?

805
01:09:11,627 --> 01:09:14,356
I think you should rather
go home and figure it out.

806
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,771
See you tomorrow.

807
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,655
You know where you'll find me.

808
01:11:09,897 --> 01:11:12,806
Katerina, are you changed your hair?

809
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:17,345
I'll leave you.

810
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:19,118
Nice to meet you.

811
01:11:23,602 --> 01:11:25,099
Would you prefer a drink?

812
01:11:25,143 --> 01:11:26,654
Sure, but I don't have much time.

813
01:11:27,069 --> 01:11:29,380
I did not know you would coming.
On what occasion?

814
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,386
Do I need one?

815
01:11:32,003 --> 01:11:33,653
I'm on my way to Vienna, for a meeting

816
01:11:33,804 --> 01:11:35,490
and I thought I do visit you.

817
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:39,428
- What happened to your eye?
- I bumped it into the pool.

818
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:42,264
Do you have any news about
our American friends?

819
01:11:42,519 --> 01:11:45,110
He become to lose his guard around me.

820
01:11:45,904 --> 01:11:49,983
He told me about what happened at the
park after I established trust.

821
01:11:58,017 --> 01:12:00,002
- So... how was he?
- A memorable.

822
01:12:00,977 --> 01:12:03,098
- But he's handsome, right?
- Is he?

823
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:11,389
Is there anything out of the ordinary that
you would like to report?

824
01:12:11,807 --> 01:12:13,332
If you lose contact...

825
01:12:14,116 --> 01:12:16,207
or if he goes missing for a day or more...

826
01:12:16,571 --> 01:12:19,658
you need to let me know, because our
superiors getting impatient.

827
01:12:20,104 --> 01:12:21,645
I have something for you.

828
01:12:24,436 --> 01:12:25,574
Something new.

829
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:28,020
A case with great potential.

830
01:12:28,425 --> 01:12:31,250
I thought I made it very clear
you only have one mission.

831
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:35,746
A Russian agent inside the American
government is always of value, is it not?

832
01:12:36,329 --> 01:12:39,331
Marta and I are developing
the asset together.

833
01:12:39,673 --> 01:12:41,170
A Senator, Chief of Staff.

834
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:42,963
And she is willing to cooperate?

835
01:12:43,253 --> 01:12:45,082
She is compromised, she has no choice.

836
01:12:45,206 --> 01:12:46,933
- When will you see her again?
- In London.

837
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:50,184
In a weeks time. But we need more money.

838
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:53,070
Your blackmail will not be enough
to establish a long-term exchange.

839
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:54,625
What do you have in mind?

840
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,370
$ 250,000.

841
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:01,692
That's a lot of money.

842
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,158
Buy you can get it.

843
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,203
I have to leave.

844
01:13:16,028 --> 01:13:17,800
- Oh... I forgot my coat.
- I'll get it.

845
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:36,734
Thank you.

846
01:13:55,173 --> 01:13:58,098
I have waited a lifetime
for something like Swan.

847
01:13:59,403 --> 01:14:01,704
I've worked a year developing her.

848
01:14:02,742 --> 01:14:06,463
- She is not your's to trade.
- Now you have the money to make the exchange.

849
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,492
I'll make sure you get the credit.

850
01:14:08,763 --> 01:14:11,044
I just need more time. Please.

851
01:14:11,657 --> 01:14:14,877
- What do they have on you?
- I saw something that I not supposed to.

852
01:14:14,902 --> 01:14:16,231
What, did you see?

853
01:14:18,306 --> 01:14:20,167
You will not get swan for free.

854
01:14:20,612 --> 01:14:22,963
I was there the night they
killed Dmitri Ustinov.

855
01:14:23,214 --> 01:14:25,274
They where telling
me to cut my throat.

856
01:14:27,415 --> 01:14:28,491
Will you help me?

857
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:30,798
I don't have a fucking choice.

858
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:30,657
What would you give me,
if I told you how to get rid of Katerina?

859
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:37,554
What do you want?

860
01:15:39,817 --> 01:15:41,030
Oh..am I too late?

861
01:15:42,796 --> 01:15:45,540
Sorry, we're closed. You can come
again tomorrow morning. We open at 9.

862
01:15:45,564 --> 01:15:48,684
I am not going to be here tomorrow.
Is there any way you can make an exception?

863
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:52,283
Please. I wanted to open an
account for a family member.

864
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:53,644
In case anything happens to me.

865
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,155
I can't let you in.

866
01:15:55,271 --> 01:15:57,017
Maybe you could take the form,

867
01:15:57,128 --> 01:16:00,587
and I could buy you a coffee and
we could fill them out together?

868
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,858
Do you have a passport and
you know all the information?

869
01:16:04,882 --> 01:16:06,470
- Yes, I have everything.
- OK.

870
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,446
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

871
01:16:33,816 --> 01:16:34,820
Marta?

872
01:16:42,959 --> 01:16:44,057
Marta?

873
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,150
Have you ever been to a farm?

874
01:17:09,611 --> 01:17:13,475
That’s what it smells like
when you butcher an animal.

875
01:17:14,048 --> 01:17:15,934
I took my time with her.

876
01:17:17,002 --> 01:17:20,994
So you would see what happens
when you tell the secrets.

877
01:17:21,718 --> 01:17:23,992
Please, please.

878
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:25,844
This is your only warning.

879
01:17:27,986 --> 01:17:28,988
Now,

880
01:17:29,735 --> 01:17:31,157
call the police!

881
01:17:39,977 --> 01:17:41,397
Where the fuck have you been?

882
01:17:49,507 --> 01:17:50,511
Close the door.

883
01:17:58,154 --> 01:17:59,636
Marble surfaced.

884
01:17:59,711 --> 01:18:01,622
Jesus Christ. Here?

885
01:18:02,204 --> 01:18:03,208
In Vienna.

886
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:04,660
You don't say anything?

887
01:18:04,991 --> 01:18:06,199
What is that?

888
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,452
It's a warning,

889
01:18:09,366 --> 01:18:10,843
She is a sparrow.

890
01:18:11,142 --> 01:18:12,740
I told you she is way out of your league.

891
01:18:12,764 --> 01:18:14,514
I think she's still recruitable.

892
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:17,843
Now that we know what we are dealing,
maybe we can do more so.

893
01:18:17,904 --> 01:18:21,319
She is a Sparrow we can't trust a fuck,
no word that comes out of her mouth

894
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:24,634
Yeah?

895
01:18:25,977 --> 01:18:26,981
When?

896
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,174
And you came home to
find out how I did this?

897
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:31,291
Yes

898
01:18:35,284 --> 01:18:36,766
This was not just a break in.

899
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:39,367
This was torture. A punishment.

900
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:41,555
Any idea why someone would do this to her?

901
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:47,608
What happened to your eye?

902
01:18:50,678 --> 01:18:52,171
Did you get along with her?

903
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,246
- You're upset.
- Of course I'm fucking upset!

904
01:19:03,589 --> 01:19:05,394
You know something, don't you?

905
01:19:07,224 --> 01:19:09,572
Whoever it is your shielding...

906
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:11,972
whoever you are scared of...

907
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:14,486
- we can protect you.
- May I go?

908
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:21,393
I'm assuming that you
guys were pretty close.

909
01:19:23,289 --> 01:19:25,408
He must be pretty scared.

910
01:19:26,043 --> 01:19:27,691
For yourself.

911
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:32,273
When I was in Moscow, they talked about
a program that Khrushchev had set up.

912
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:36,805
Young Officers trained to
seduce and manipulate.

913
01:19:37,154 --> 01:19:38,503
They called them Sparrows.

914
01:19:39,517 --> 01:19:40,957
That is what you are, that is right?

915
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:44,533
The thing I just can not wrap my
hair around is, why a man would

916
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:48,697
put his niece trough something like that?

917
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:58,263
I was told to take a man to a hotel.

918
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:00,487
To get information.

919
01:20:02,585 --> 01:20:05,100
They said he was an enemy of the state.

920
01:20:05,793 --> 01:20:09,046
And in exchange my mother would
get the Doctor she needed.

921
01:20:11,662 --> 01:20:13,578
Instead, they cut his throat.

922
01:20:13,885 --> 01:20:15,921
He died on top of me.

923
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:22,203
There could be no witnesses,
so my uncle gave me a choice.

924
01:20:22,394 --> 01:20:23,394
Die...

925
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:25,141
or become a Sparrow.

926
01:20:26,151 --> 01:20:27,812
What they did to Marta was a message.

927
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:31,875
They cut her open to show me what they will
do to me if I don't give them what they want.

928
01:20:31,947 --> 01:20:33,700
- What do they want?
- A name.

929
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,317
They think you're an agent.

930
01:20:35,694 --> 01:20:36,698
What do you think?

931
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,235
I don't care.

932
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:41,161
I just want my mother to be safe.

933
01:20:41,201 --> 01:20:43,228
The man that you work for,
man like your uncle,

934
01:20:43,253 --> 01:20:45,340
they never let you go, no
matter what you getting.

935
01:20:45,365 --> 01:20:46,906
This is how they function.

936
01:20:47,512 --> 01:20:50,512
You only matter because of what you can do,
for me don't exist

937
01:20:50,743 --> 01:20:52,395
unless they say so.

938
01:20:53,667 --> 01:20:54,867
And that's just now, I mean...

939
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,300
when you where dancing

940
01:20:59,085 --> 01:21:00,435
you dancing for them.

941
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:02,139
Because they where letting you.

942
01:21:02,164 --> 01:21:03,507
You can see it now, right?

943
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:06,354
You belong to them, pretty much your life.

944
01:21:10,046 --> 01:21:12,998
So... Dominika, work with me.

945
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:19,085
Make this something you own, for the
first time in your life.

946
01:21:21,005 --> 01:21:23,475
Make them fucking pay.

947
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:25,998
What is it do you want from me?

948
01:21:26,225 --> 01:21:27,632
Whatever you can give us.

949
01:21:27,987 --> 01:21:29,807
But if I have my choice,

950
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:31,563
access to your uncle.

951
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,272
Be your spy?

952
01:21:34,257 --> 01:21:35,257
Is it?

953
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:37,514
Is that any different from being his spy?

954
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:40,510
Yes, because I would never
ask you to do what he did.

955
01:21:40,665 --> 01:21:42,279
Nothing is worth that.

956
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:45,249
I need to sleep.

957
01:21:45,618 --> 01:21:47,105
Why don't you take my room.

958
01:21:55,067 --> 01:21:57,983
You asked me why I fired a gun in Moscow.

959
01:21:58,564 --> 01:22:02,247
The man I was protecting
had everything to lose.

960
01:22:02,587 --> 01:22:04,459
He was benefiting from the system,

961
01:22:04,484 --> 01:22:06,812
but when he saw what was
happening in his name...

962
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:09,737
He didn’t just say that he didn't know.

963
01:22:10,077 --> 01:22:12,140
He risked his life. He risked everything.

964
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:14,718
He didn't deserve to die
in a cellar somewhere.

965
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:16,453
If you do this...

966
01:22:16,844 --> 01:22:19,343
I will do everything in
my power to protect you.

967
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:50,384
Can I trust you?

968
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:54,388
I promise, you can.

969
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:07,317
Wait, wait, don't.

970
01:24:17,027 --> 01:24:18,033
Thank you.

971
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:25,884
I danced my first solo to this.

972
01:24:27,406 --> 01:24:28,673
It's Grieg.

973
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,868
I was so nervous the night
before,

974
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:33,967
I couldn't sleep.

975
01:24:35,268 --> 01:24:37,564
And I played this music in my
room and...

976
01:24:38,179 --> 01:24:38,813
and...

977
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,702
after I felt asleep I dreamed that...

978
01:24:42,474 --> 01:24:45,493
the music was color... and I could

979
01:24:46,384 --> 01:24:48,501
and I could paint it on all
the audiences

980
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:51,157
faces with my hands.

981
01:25:03,658 --> 01:25:05,848
I'm sorry about what happened to you.

982
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:12,503
I'm really pretty glad that you're here.

983
01:25:12,827 --> 01:25:13,973
Me too.

984
01:25:14,474 --> 01:25:15,719
Are you sure about this?

985
01:25:17,623 --> 01:25:19,545
Alright. Listen,

986
01:25:24,307 --> 01:25:25,883
This is what I want you to do.

987
01:25:26,059 --> 01:25:27,906
Go back to your normal routine.

988
01:25:28,143 --> 01:25:31,640
Go in to work and write
a report, about me.

989
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:35,107
About the time we spent
and how close we became.

990
01:25:36,536 --> 01:25:39,132
Say that I am a
fool and you've got me on a hook.

991
01:25:39,329 --> 01:25:42,179
Write that I am ambitious,
and that I drink.

992
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,852
And then I ask him to prove to my father...
on which means, I will make a mistake.

993
01:25:46,853 --> 01:25:48,484
Then I need you to go home.

994
01:25:48,798 --> 01:25:51,670
The police will be finish
with the apartment by this evening.

995
01:25:52,306 --> 01:25:54,093
And then just wait for my signal.

996
01:25:57,704 --> 01:25:58,718
Hallo!

997
01:26:08,473 --> 01:26:11,185
I'm going to ask you some routine
questions to begin.

998
01:26:12,414 --> 01:26:13,527
Name?

999
01:26:13,593 --> 01:26:14,883
Dominika Egorova.

1000
01:26:16,264 --> 01:26:18,646
- Did you eat breakfast this morning?
- Yes.

1001
01:26:19,037 --> 01:26:21,866
Are you an Officer of the
Russian Intelligence Service?

1002
01:26:22,446 --> 01:26:23,452
Yes.

1003
01:26:24,064 --> 01:26:27,713
Are you here because CIA,
whoever named Nate Nash, recruited you?

1004
01:26:27,842 --> 01:26:28,848
Yes.

1005
01:26:30,938 --> 01:26:33,314
Are you willing to work
for the American government?

1006
01:26:33,378 --> 01:26:34,384
Yes.

1007
01:26:34,824 --> 01:26:37,529
And you intend to give
us genuine information?

1008
01:26:38,304 --> 01:26:39,309
Yes or no?

1009
01:26:39,415 --> 01:26:40,205
Yes.

1010
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:41,378
Why would you do that?

1011
01:26:41,809 --> 01:26:43,436
I thought it was just yes or no.

1012
01:26:43,522 --> 01:26:44,705
I'm just curious.

1013
01:26:45,813 --> 01:26:47,837
I know the nature from the men I work for.

1014
01:26:47,965 --> 01:26:49,208
Why do you work for them?

1015
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:50,228
They gave me no choice.

1016
01:26:50,293 --> 01:26:51,293
I have a question .. You

1017
01:26:51,446 --> 01:26:53,206
You only spike when Nate's name comes up.

1018
01:26:53,778 --> 01:26:56,362
- Did you engaged in sexual intercourse with him?
- Hey, that's...

1019
01:26:56,386 --> 01:26:58,627
- Take it easy.
- That's what you do, right?

1020
01:26:58,773 --> 01:27:00,050
- Marty.
- What you are trained for.

1021
01:27:00,074 --> 01:27:01,080
- Marty.
- Did anyone tell you...

1022
01:27:01,104 --> 01:27:02,227
anybody ever told you that..

1023
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:04,094
- Why do you want to know that, Bratok?

1024
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,142
Big Brother?

1025
01:27:05,759 --> 01:27:07,091
Please answer the question.

1026
01:27:07,234 --> 01:27:09,305
We need to know if you're
emotionally involved.

1027
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,336
The answer is no.

1028
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:15,551
So..are you satisfied?

1029
01:27:16,668 --> 01:27:18,192
- Yeah.
- If I'm going to work for you,

1030
01:27:18,368 --> 01:27:21,212
you need to transfer money
to my bank account in Vienna.

1031
01:27:22,434 --> 01:27:24,175
$ 30,000 to start with.

1032
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,923
I don't know what you an Nate
discussed,

1033
01:27:27,954 --> 01:27:30,436
but I think we are getting a
little ahead of our self sweetheart to.

1034
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,756
See what you brought us.
If it's significant...

1035
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,107
what about the Senators Chief of Staff?

1036
01:27:35,298 --> 01:27:36,232
Excuse me?

1037
01:27:36,257 --> 01:27:38,940
A Chief of Staff run by the SVR?

1038
01:27:39,195 --> 01:27:42,773
She agreed to sell information
on a Satellite Defense System.

1039
01:27:42,855 --> 01:27:45,253
I fly to London on Friday to meet with her.

1040
01:27:47,709 --> 01:27:49,923
Shall I provide you with
the account information?

1041
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,196
Here she is.

1042
01:28:24,403 --> 01:28:25,709
It's to the left.

1043
01:28:31,423 --> 01:28:32,428
Look... here we go.

1044
01:28:44,745 --> 01:28:46,026
What are you doing here?

1045
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:49,977
I thought you might need some help
after what happened to poor Marta.

1046
01:28:50,996 --> 01:28:54,382
Of course, you're lucky
not to be harmed yourself.

1047
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:56,313
I appreciate your concern.

1048
01:28:56,865 --> 01:28:59,185
So I do wonder how Swan would react
if she see me with you?

1049
01:28:59,607 --> 01:29:02,249
Do you really want to be the
multiple of this whole operation?

1050
01:29:02,497 --> 01:29:05,108
Director Egorova would be very displeased.

1051
01:29:06,264 --> 01:29:09,702
Go upstairs, Room 624.
I'll call you if I need you.

1052
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:12,298
Go.

1053
01:29:28,407 --> 01:29:30,087
- Who the hell is that?
- He's gotta a key.

1054
01:29:30,322 --> 01:29:32,396
Did you see anybody else
was going in that room?

1055
01:29:32,421 --> 01:29:35,676
No, I think that's... Yes, it's Volontov.

1056
01:29:36,582 --> 01:29:38,037
That’s her boss.

1057
01:29:45,739 --> 01:29:46,743
Vodka.

1058
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:07,825
- Do I know you?
- We have a friend in common.

1059
01:30:09,692 --> 01:30:10,699
Where is she?

1060
01:30:10,963 --> 01:30:15,045
Unfortunately, Marta wasn't able
to make it, so... she sent me.

1061
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:18,333
Hm...

1062
01:30:18,763 --> 01:30:20,034
I was just leaving.

1063
01:30:34,509 --> 01:30:37,985
Do you think I care about
people who I meeting with?

1064
01:30:38,952 --> 01:30:40,417
I think in this case you might.

1065
01:30:40,523 --> 01:30:42,855
Marta is a well-known intelligence Officer.

1066
01:30:43,221 --> 01:30:45,823
When photographs of your
relationship going public,

1067
01:30:45,848 --> 01:30:48,199
you lose your security
clearance and your job.

1068
01:30:48,497 --> 01:30:52,549
But I don't think that any of that is
necessary. You're here for business, as am I.

1069
01:30:52,748 --> 01:30:55,746
$ 250,000 was a figured
that you agreed upon.

1070
01:30:56,478 --> 01:30:58,972
Your daughters tuition
payments are coming out.

1071
01:30:59,568 --> 01:31:02,204
I believe your ex-husband
is about to lose another job.

1072
01:31:05,109 --> 01:31:08,306
Don't you think you'd be
more comfortable in the private room?

1073
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:10,483
Where did they find you?

1074
01:31:11,019 --> 01:31:11,970
Follow me.

1075
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:13,790
- You are out here with him?
- Yes.

1076
01:31:13,815 --> 01:31:15,978
Let's get the show on the road.

1077
01:31:18,929 --> 01:31:21,126
Is this Colonel Maxim Volontov?

1078
01:31:21,569 --> 01:31:23,887
He is the Chief of the
Budapest resident area.

1079
01:31:25,347 --> 01:31:27,362
A real drink, would you Boris?

1080
01:31:29,171 --> 01:31:30,433
Let's get done with it.

1081
01:31:30,704 --> 01:31:32,172
You heard her. Make her a drink.

1082
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,005
So...

1083
01:31:36,435 --> 01:31:37,440
shall we proceed?

1084
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:42,544
I just wanna be a clear.
I am here strictly explorigly matter.

1085
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:46,607
As long as what you have to offer is a value,
I am sure we will have no difficulties.

1086
01:31:47,073 --> 01:31:50,341
I am a Chief of Staff to
a United States Senator.

1087
01:31:51,674 --> 01:31:53,084
The last person had
my job headed to the

1088
01:31:53,108 --> 01:31:55,426
the fucking CIA, being
in the room with me.

1089
01:31:56,926 --> 01:31:58,216
Fucking value.

1090
01:32:00,091 --> 01:32:01,654
I think she is drunk.

1091
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:03,064
- You think?

1092
01:32:03,177 --> 01:32:05,385
And I'm sure that if you
are as important as

1093
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:07,568
you say, you don't
want to waste any time.

1094
01:32:08,262 --> 01:32:09,262
So...

1095
01:32:09,686 --> 01:32:10,942
do you have anything to sell?

1096
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:13,052
I have the first set of disks with me.

1097
01:32:14,013 --> 01:32:15,105
Today.

1098
01:32:15,377 --> 01:32:18,095
I just wanna make clear that
I'm not doing this because

1099
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,836
I am..a..ideologist or pacifist
or something, you know.

1100
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:24,699
Where are the discs, Stephanie?

1101
01:32:25,287 --> 01:32:26,405
Where is my money?

1102
01:32:26,646 --> 01:32:29,124
$ 250,000 for delivery, as agreed.

1103
01:32:39,125 --> 01:32:40,125
Yeap!

1104
01:32:46,397 --> 01:32:47,397
Sorry.

1105
01:32:54,028 --> 01:32:56,156
I just need to authenticate them.

1106
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:15,293
Why don't you give me a real pour, Boris?

1107
01:33:17,787 --> 01:33:19,504
Why don’t you get it yourself?

1108
01:33:21,514 --> 01:33:22,750
Everything alright?

1109
01:33:33,575 --> 01:33:34,579
Everything OK?

1110
01:33:35,355 --> 01:33:37,262
I just have to wait for them to load.

1111
01:33:54,855 --> 01:33:56,083
Tell me, Boris?

1112
01:33:56,703 --> 01:34:00,269
You got a little babushka back in Moscow?

1113
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:02,285
Of course you do.

1114
01:34:02,717 --> 01:34:04,618
It never seizes to amaze me.

1115
01:34:05,179 --> 01:34:07,788
Why are all Russian women so sexy?

1116
01:34:08,599 --> 01:34:10,160
All the men look like turds.

1117
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:22,619
No, no, no, don't.

1118
01:34:24,384 --> 01:34:27,081
- Where you going?
- I will go to buy her some more time.

1119
01:34:28,832 --> 01:34:31,043
- Why does it take so long?
- Just one more minute.

1120
01:34:33,023 --> 01:34:34,668
What a fuck is that...?

1121
01:34:38,364 --> 01:34:40,218
Just checking. Is everything
all right with your room, Sir?

1122
01:34:40,242 --> 01:34:40,921
Fine.

1123
01:34:41,191 --> 01:34:44,004
- Shall I check the minibar?
- There is no need.

1124
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:50,742
Sorry to disturb you.

1125
01:35:02,261 --> 01:35:03,409
It's finished.

1126
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:05,505
Everything seems to be in order.

1127
01:35:06,313 --> 01:35:07,734
One more minute longer,

1128
01:35:09,601 --> 01:35:11,135
I'm going to shoot her.

1129
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:13,430
Did she get her?

1130
01:35:14,563 --> 01:35:15,563
She did.

1131
01:35:17,063 --> 01:35:18,066
Nice accent.

1132
01:35:18,533 --> 01:35:19,800
I will leave now.

1133
01:35:20,244 --> 01:35:22,119
You wait an hour and then you go.

1134
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,173
Will be in touch for the next delivery.

1135
01:35:29,229 --> 01:35:30,229
Sure thing.

1136
01:35:55,615 --> 01:35:56,615
Fuck it!

1137
01:36:05,038 --> 01:36:07,190
Oh, oh... she took the money.

1138
01:36:07,432 --> 01:36:08,635
She took the money.

1139
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,040
There he go.

1140
01:36:10,096 --> 01:36:12,565
We will get the discs and take
them back to the field office.

1141
01:36:12,623 --> 01:36:14,586
I follow as soon as I
get that squared away.

1142
01:37:41,868 --> 01:37:43,430
Make the necessary arrangements.

1143
01:37:44,052 --> 01:37:46,675
Change of plans.
We go directly to Heathrow.

1144
01:37:47,179 --> 01:37:49,976
Moscow wants to congratulate us in person.

1145
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:51,839
I'll call the Director Egorova.

1146
01:37:52,045 --> 01:37:53,090
No need.

1147
01:37:53,393 --> 01:37:56,065
Director Egorova gave the order himself.

1148
01:37:56,318 --> 01:37:58,596
The disks and your passport.

1149
01:38:07,759 --> 01:38:08,933
Turn the car around.

1150
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,898
Yeah?

1151
01:38:26,643 --> 01:38:27,726
<i>Boucher is dead.</i>

1152
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:30,004
What are you talking about?

1153
01:38:30,243 --> 01:38:32,203
<i>Our guys outside went
after the money too early.</i>

1154
01:38:32,557 --> 01:38:35,285
<i>She panicked.
Stepped in front of a fucking truck.</i>

1155
01:38:35,773 --> 01:38:36,918
What a fuck!

1156
01:38:38,462 --> 01:38:40,038
You think they had somebody in the hotel?

1157
01:38:40,062 --> 01:38:41,106
<i>- How would if.</i>

1158
01:38:41,508 --> 01:38:44,133
<i>If they think she tipped
us off, they would have kill her.</i>

1159
01:38:44,231 --> 01:38:47,487
<i>And Nate, the till car changed direction.</i>

1160
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:49,303
Looks like they headed to Heathrow.

1161
01:38:49,563 --> 01:38:53,032
Fuck, Trish! We fucked her real.
Fucked her!

1162
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,869
You look nervous.

1163
01:39:42,201 --> 01:39:43,973
They entering Terminal 2.
Looks like Aeroflot.

1164
01:39:43,997 --> 01:39:45,122
<i>Looks like Aeroflot.</i>

1165
01:40:05,298 --> 01:40:07,268
<i>This is a boarding announcement .</i>

1166
01:40:08,121 --> 01:40:11,666
<i>British European Airways flight 422
to Amsterdam .</i>

1167
01:40:11,792 --> 01:40:13,785
<i>Will begin boarding shortly.</i>

1168
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:17,711
<i>All passengers please proceed to Gate B-42.</i>

1169
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:28,935
Passport?

1170
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,723
Enjoy your flight.

1171
01:40:58,206 --> 01:40:59,208
Damned!

1172
01:41:13,253 --> 01:41:15,433
I always had my doubts about her.

1173
01:41:17,218 --> 01:41:18,368
She is my niece.

1174
01:41:18,993 --> 01:41:20,089
What?

1175
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:21,125
My brother's daughter.

1176
01:41:21,462 --> 01:41:24,252
Give me the discs, please.

1177
01:41:25,619 --> 01:41:26,621
Of course.

1178
01:41:27,904 --> 01:41:29,622
Thank you. Take him away.

1179
01:41:47,629 --> 01:41:50,247
Did you give Mrs. Boucher to Americans?

1180
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:54,710
No.

1181
01:41:55,011 --> 01:41:56,071
Who did?

1182
01:41:56,483 --> 01:41:57,524
I don't know.

1183
01:42:02,956 --> 01:42:04,077
You can start.

1184
01:42:43,831 --> 01:42:45,448
Let's start again.

1185
01:42:46,447 --> 01:42:48,837
Did you give Boucher to Americans?

1186
01:42:50,546 --> 01:42:51,546
No.

1187
01:43:01,563 --> 01:43:04,036
Did you give Boucher to Americans?

1188
01:43:04,797 --> 01:43:05,798
No.

1189
01:43:21,566 --> 01:43:23,329
Are you working for the Americans?

1190
01:43:24,044 --> 01:43:25,990
I love my country.

1191
01:43:44,673 --> 01:43:47,164
You gave Boucher to Americans.

1192
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:51,376
For money?

1193
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:55,388
Or for the handsome American?

1194
01:43:57,316 --> 01:43:58,316
No.

1195
01:44:12,904 --> 01:44:15,424
Did you tell the Americans about Boucher?

1196
01:44:16,592 --> 01:44:17,592
No.

1197
01:44:25,127 --> 01:44:26,162
The last time.

1198
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:28,470
Did you tell the Americans about Boucher?

1199
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:29,732
No.

1200
01:44:47,375 --> 01:44:48,480
The last time.

1201
01:44:49,882 --> 01:44:52,142
Did you give Boucher to Americans?

1202
01:44:58,878 --> 01:44:59,879
No.

1203
01:45:41,003 --> 01:45:42,074
Please.

1204
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:44,490
Please stop.

1205
01:45:44,818 --> 01:45:46,295
You made a mistake.

1206
01:45:57,286 --> 01:45:58,516
It's not your fault.

1207
01:45:59,112 --> 01:46:01,555
You have to tell them
what they want to know.

1208
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:02,707
Please.

1209
01:46:03,493 --> 01:46:07,660
I can only protect you
if you tell the truth.

1210
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:10,462
The truth?

1211
01:46:13,377 --> 01:46:16,497
There is no other mission than this one.

1212
01:46:18,786 --> 01:46:21,735
Follow the trail wherever it leads.

1213
01:46:22,389 --> 01:46:25,228
Sacrifice whatever has to be sacrificed.

1214
01:46:25,652 --> 01:46:27,794
If they have my real name,

1215
01:46:28,131 --> 01:46:29,443
If they have a swan,

1216
01:46:30,335 --> 01:46:32,068
if you torture me,

1217
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:34,943
they will trust me.

1218
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:36,859
How could they don't.

1219
01:46:38,707 --> 01:46:40,336
You will not give up now.

1220
01:46:41,063 --> 01:46:42,139
Send me back.

1221
01:46:42,552 --> 01:46:44,148
Let me finish what we started.

1222
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:49,715
Did they do well uncle?

1223
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:56,473
And I?

1224
01:47:16,378 --> 01:47:18,996
Oh, my child.

1225
01:47:20,433 --> 01:47:22,016
What happened to you?

1226
01:47:22,465 --> 01:47:25,096
I was questioned by security services.

1227
01:47:25,901 --> 01:47:27,679
But they let you go?

1228
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:30,539
Of course I'm innocent.

1229
01:47:48,445 --> 01:47:50,585
Chief Zakharov expects
you, Deputy Director.

1230
01:47:50,891 --> 01:47:53,559
The President is furious
about the loss of Boucher.

1231
01:47:54,032 --> 01:47:56,943
The mole would have got her anyway.
Now we get something in return.

1232
01:47:57,576 --> 01:48:00,619
His patience with your
niece is growing thin.

1233
01:48:01,044 --> 01:48:02,677
The Americans will trust her.

1234
01:48:02,702 --> 01:48:03,768
So.. you saying.

1235
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,995
I think Dominika had her chance.

1236
01:48:07,278 --> 01:48:10,692
It is my opinion, she has developed
feelings for the American.

1237
01:48:12,370 --> 01:48:14,197
She has made a fool of you, Ivan.

1238
01:48:15,168 --> 01:48:16,431
Send her back to Nash.

1239
01:48:16,914 --> 01:48:18,380
Let Matorin shadow her.

1240
01:48:18,783 --> 01:48:21,567
If she is compromised he will find out.

1241
01:48:22,435 --> 01:48:24,307
The Americans will respond.

1242
01:48:25,348 --> 01:48:26,691
Nothing that we can not handle.

1243
01:48:26,961 --> 01:48:28,551
And what of Dominika?

1244
01:48:29,431 --> 01:48:30,911
Let her leash to her uncle.

1245
01:48:32,714 --> 01:48:35,159
Shall we tell the President
you priority ties to the safety of

1246
01:48:35,184 --> 01:48:37,221
the safety of your niece or the mission?

1247
01:48:37,851 --> 01:48:39,586
If she is compromised,

1248
01:48:41,374 --> 01:48:44,625
I promise she will be eliminated.

1249
01:48:46,867 --> 01:48:48,440
Thank you, Ivan.

1250
01:48:49,771 --> 01:48:51,787
You're welcome, Chief Zakharov.

1251
01:48:54,805 --> 01:48:55,997
Enjoy your night.

1252
01:49:11,471 --> 01:49:15,288
I'd ask you how you could in but
this is what we've taught you, isn't it?

1253
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:19,109
Did they grant my request?

1254
01:49:19,584 --> 01:49:21,011
Yes, they did.

1255
01:49:48,812 --> 01:49:50,104
You're right.

1256
01:49:51,561 --> 01:49:52,889
I'm like you, uncle.

1257
01:50:29,612 --> 01:50:30,614
Oh, God!

1258
01:50:31,907 --> 01:50:33,183
Oh, thank God.

1259
01:50:37,441 --> 01:50:39,642
You know what this looks like, right?

1260
01:50:41,518 --> 01:50:44,603
They just let you go. Why would they do it?

1261
01:50:44,772 --> 01:50:47,712
Because I told them
that you would trust me now.

1262
01:50:48,165 --> 01:50:50,381
Enough to give me the name of the mole.

1263
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:55,116
But you know I can't do that.

1264
01:50:55,866 --> 01:50:56,904
Of course I do.

1265
01:50:58,250 --> 01:50:59,260
So what next then?

1266
01:50:59,744 --> 01:51:01,369
I want to go to America.

1267
01:51:02,194 --> 01:51:04,095
Where I can be safe. Please.

1268
01:51:06,234 --> 01:51:07,686
- Alright.
- And my mother?

1269
01:51:08,491 --> 01:51:10,873
It will take some time, but
we can't get around, yeah?

1270
01:51:11,676 --> 01:51:13,590
And the money I was promised?

1271
01:51:13,933 --> 01:51:16,344
You'll get it. $ 30,000
in a bank in Vienna.

1272
01:51:16,631 --> 01:51:18,483
We couldn’t release payment
while you are in custody.

1273
01:51:18,507 --> 01:51:19,830
It is not enough.

1274
01:51:21,153 --> 01:51:23,128
How much do you want?

1275
01:51:24,186 --> 01:51:25,872
I need $ 250,000,

1276
01:51:26,977 --> 01:51:28,661
for resettlement.

1277
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:30,198
OK.

1278
01:51:31,665 --> 01:51:32,951
You are helping me

1279
01:51:33,924 --> 01:51:36,447
with no, obvious advantages.

1280
01:51:37,373 --> 01:51:38,924
That is not what I expected.

1281
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:43,054
If I hadn't waved you away at the
airport, what would you have done?

1282
01:51:43,438 --> 01:51:45,197
I would have kill them for you.

1283
01:52:25,794 --> 01:52:26,796
Nate?

1284
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:35,740
Nate?

1285
01:53:53,088 --> 01:53:54,582
Do you know what this is?

1286
01:53:55,875 --> 01:53:57,648
They use it for skin grafting.

1287
01:53:58,504 --> 01:53:59,696
Burning victims,

1288
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:03,496
the blades so fine, you barely bleed

1289
01:54:03,942 --> 01:54:08,191
Do you know how long it takes to
peel the skin from a human being?

1290
01:54:08,351 --> 01:54:12,305
Hours. Even if you are good at it.

1291
01:54:13,248 --> 01:54:15,602
And I, I take my time with it.

1292
01:54:17,861 --> 01:54:20,537
Layer by layer.

1293
01:54:21,843 --> 01:54:23,797
Until I see the white

1294
01:54:24,852 --> 01:54:27,115
of the bone.

1295
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:32,613
You know what we want to know...

1296
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:36,639
but they wont stop until long after
you ready to talk.

1297
01:54:37,501 --> 01:54:41,874
If you pass out, I will inject
with a stimulate.

1298
01:54:42,392 --> 01:54:45,230
You will stay conscious
until we finished.

1299
01:55:15,057 --> 01:55:16,346
What's the name, Nate?

1300
01:55:16,909 --> 01:55:18,595
What's the name?

1301
01:55:19,648 --> 01:55:20,649
No?

1302
01:55:21,833 --> 01:55:23,032
Do you want more?

1303
01:55:23,785 --> 01:55:25,613
No, please.

1304
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:27,175
So, we go deeper.

1305
01:55:30,943 --> 01:55:31,944
No!

1306
01:55:46,124 --> 01:55:47,149
No?

1307
01:55:49,115 --> 01:55:50,838
Come on, Nate, the name?

1308
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:52,825
What's the name?

1309
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:56,600
No?

1310
01:55:58,057 --> 01:55:59,749
Give it to me. Let me try.

1311
01:56:01,787 --> 01:56:03,388
Wait, wait.

1312
01:56:07,347 --> 01:56:09,217
Oh, God!

1313
01:56:19,109 --> 01:56:20,110
No?

1314
01:57:24,599 --> 01:57:25,600
Nate.

1315
01:57:25,706 --> 01:57:26,707
Nate?

1316
01:57:27,691 --> 01:57:30,539
Call the Embassy. The Embassy.

1317
01:58:18,103 --> 01:58:20,158
It was you who killed Matorin, wasn't it?

1318
01:58:20,494 --> 01:58:21,511
I can explain.

1319
01:58:21,611 --> 01:58:22,809
I'm sure you can.

1320
01:58:25,605 --> 01:58:27,844
My wife had dreamed about
becoming a dancer.

1321
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:29,864
Long before I met her.

1322
01:58:30,558 --> 01:58:35,248
Of course, she was nothing on you, but she
used to dance for me in our living room.

1323
01:58:35,874 --> 01:58:37,197
When she felt ill

1324
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:40,128
the Russian Embassy in New York refused...

1325
01:58:40,279 --> 01:58:42,403
to let an American Doctor operate on her.

1326
01:58:43,565 --> 01:58:47,184
Some... pity bureaucrats I offended,

1327
01:58:47,277 --> 01:58:48,840
sentenced her to death.

1328
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:51,243
What passes for power.

1329
01:58:53,629 --> 01:58:56,288
I know you gave the Americans Boucher.

1330
01:58:56,862 --> 01:58:58,222
Only so that they would trust me.

1331
01:58:58,372 --> 01:58:59,727
And now we have to trust you?

1332
01:59:07,583 --> 01:59:13,219
I was born three days after
Stalin has led in state.

1333
01:59:15,023 --> 01:59:17,060
My father fought for him during the war.

1334
01:59:18,328 --> 01:59:20,695
He was party member.
We got privileges.

1335
01:59:25,186 --> 01:59:28,193
It took me few years to realize
I've been born in a prison.

1336
01:59:28,592 --> 01:59:30,699
Prisons makes a beast out of a man.

1337
01:59:30,936 --> 01:59:32,607
I learned to cheat, to lie,

1338
01:59:34,146 --> 01:59:36,200
to others before they do to me

1339
01:59:37,338 --> 01:59:38,475
to survive

1340
01:59:39,741 --> 01:59:41,334
by any means

1341
01:59:42,048 --> 01:59:43,182
so I had to decide,

1342
01:59:44,019 --> 01:59:46,271
Die in the prison where I was
born

1343
01:59:48,183 --> 01:59:50,009
or choose another side,

1344
01:59:51,006 --> 01:59:52,812
our clumsy American friends,

1345
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:56,787
for whom individual freedom
is at least an inspiration.

1346
01:59:59,777 --> 02:00:02,521
So now, you know. I'm the mole.

1347
02:00:03,475 --> 02:00:04,930
I am the man you're looking for.

1348
02:00:05,866 --> 02:00:07,933
You are free to hand me over to your uncle.

1349
02:00:07,958 --> 02:00:09,467
You can give those people what they want.

1350
02:00:09,491 --> 02:00:11,247
Of course, there is another path.

1351
02:00:11,338 --> 02:00:12,544
What would that be?

1352
02:00:12,758 --> 02:00:15,100
After you turn me in, you will be a hero

1353
02:00:15,933 --> 02:00:17,169
beyond suspicion.

1354
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:24,584
The ideal position to take my place
and continue my work with the Americans.

1355
02:00:25,074 --> 02:00:28,358
May your uncle and his kind pay for what
they've done to our country.

1356
02:00:28,608 --> 02:00:29,617
They will kill you.

1357
02:00:30,327 --> 02:00:31,901
Something will slice us all.

1358
02:00:34,174 --> 02:00:37,640
You have the power to decide
whether or not I die in vain.

1359
02:00:41,418 --> 02:00:43,676
You are better in this than any others.

1360
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:49,088
This is the only way for you
to return to your mother.

1361
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:52,793
You sent Matorin, didn't you?

1362
02:00:53,953 --> 02:00:55,566
So I wouldn't have a choice.

1363
02:00:56,018 --> 02:00:57,673
So that you would see.

1364
02:00:59,236 --> 02:01:00,334
You never did.

1365
02:01:46,812 --> 02:01:47,812
Hallo!

1366
02:01:49,373 --> 02:01:50,374
Hallo!

1367
02:01:57,103 --> 02:01:58,103
Hi...

1368
02:02:22,725 --> 02:02:23,726
Stop.

1369
02:02:27,278 --> 02:02:28,360
Face the wall.

1370
02:02:32,192 --> 02:02:34,570
I want to speak with the
Russian Ambassador.

1371
02:02:34,822 --> 02:02:36,333
My name is Mikhail Sergev.

1372
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:38,750
I am an Ambassador here in Budapest.

1373
02:02:38,916 --> 02:02:42,472
Unfortunately, the Hungarians
are reviewing the diplomatic immunity.

1374
02:02:42,902 --> 02:02:43,902
Call Zakharov.

1375
02:02:44,676 --> 02:02:49,192
Tell him, I have what he wants.

1376
02:02:50,465 --> 02:02:52,148
I have the name of the mole.

1377
02:02:52,686 --> 02:02:55,010
Why wouldn't you tell me?
And I'll pass it a long.

1378
02:02:57,973 --> 02:02:59,687
Listen to me very carefully.

1379
02:02:59,859 --> 02:03:03,302
You're an arrant boy. I have an arrant.

1380
02:03:03,539 --> 02:03:06,247
You call Zakharov.
You will tell him to make a trade.

1381
02:03:06,646 --> 02:03:08,088
Me for the mole.

1382
02:03:09,011 --> 02:03:13,326
Once if that is arranged, I will
give the name to Zakharov personally.

1383
02:03:15,186 --> 02:03:17,179
Do this right, mister Ambassador?

1384
02:03:17,228 --> 02:03:19,340
And I might tell them
that this was your idea.

1385
02:03:21,192 --> 02:03:23,101
I'll see what I can do.

1386
02:03:26,751 --> 02:03:28,413
Thank you, Director Zakharov.

1387
02:03:28,785 --> 02:03:30,357
Speak of this to no one else.

1388
02:03:30,926 --> 02:03:31,927
Yes sir.

1389
02:03:38,437 --> 02:03:39,806
No loose ends.

1390
02:03:40,661 --> 02:03:42,787
Nothing that can lacks
back to the President.

1391
02:03:43,471 --> 02:03:44,471
And the girl?

1392
02:05:37,308 --> 02:05:38,615
You can uncuff her

1393
02:05:43,987 --> 02:05:46,182
All right, this is, how this is gonna go.

1394
02:05:46,775 --> 02:05:48,652
They will escort you part of the way.

1395
02:05:49,065 --> 02:05:52,592
Once you confirmed the identity of
our mole, you're going on alone.

1396
02:05:52,954 --> 02:05:54,290
You passes the mid point.

1397
02:05:54,403 --> 02:05:57,149
Don't exchange words, don't look back.

1398
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:02,094
If anything goes wrong, we abort.

1399
02:06:02,522 --> 02:06:05,360
If you try to run, we are
authorized to shoot.

1400
02:06:05,681 --> 02:06:07,746
We will not hesitate, you understand?

1401
02:06:09,591 --> 02:06:11,233
All right, Nate, it's time.

1402
02:06:21,632 --> 02:06:23,477
Your uncle will be very proud.

1403
02:06:24,739 --> 02:06:25,740
He might be.

1404
02:06:32,672 --> 02:06:35,089
Are you going to tell me how
you found out his name?

1405
02:06:35,523 --> 02:06:37,055
Is it going to make a difference?

1406
02:06:37,531 --> 02:06:41,376
There is an investigation.
They think it's me.

1407
02:06:43,115 --> 02:06:46,480
I guess that was the playing all along?

1408
02:06:47,958 --> 02:06:49,293
Stop here.

1409
02:06:51,816 --> 02:06:53,111
I got him back for you.

1410
02:06:53,424 --> 02:06:56,220
Do you think they just let him
make it a cross over a life?

1411
02:06:56,330 --> 02:06:58,972
You realize you might have just
earned to get killed?

1412
02:07:02,365 --> 02:07:04,297
I think one day you'll understand.

1413
02:07:04,627 --> 02:07:07,208
No, I don't think I will.

1414
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:09,511
Some things can't be sacrificed.

1415
02:07:09,822 --> 02:07:11,427
We don't throw people away.

1416
02:07:15,019 --> 02:07:16,189
Show us his face!

1417
02:07:33,651 --> 02:07:35,740
What the hell is going on?

1418
02:07:37,204 --> 02:07:38,475
Why is there a delay?

1419
02:07:38,652 --> 02:07:40,709
Confirm the identity of your agent

1420
02:07:42,375 --> 02:07:43,654
That's our man!

1421
02:07:45,218 --> 02:07:46,728
She fucked them.

1422
02:07:47,034 --> 02:07:48,470
Goodbye, Nate.

1423
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:01,971
Good morning.

1424
02:08:03,759 --> 02:08:04,844
Please, sit.

1425
02:08:05,479 --> 02:08:07,857
You were right about the niece.
She did very well.

1426
02:08:08,616 --> 02:08:12,792
She called from Budapest.
Gave us the name of the mole.

1427
02:08:14,216 --> 02:08:15,398
Wonderful news.

1428
02:08:15,662 --> 02:08:19,556
There was this security detail,
search the mole's office

1429
02:08:20,266 --> 02:08:21,499
his apartment.

1430
02:08:23,407 --> 02:08:26,460
The apartment was covered
in bullets

1431
02:08:27,612 --> 02:08:29,436
attributed to Nash.

1432
02:08:33,186 --> 02:08:35,521
This is a statement

1433
02:08:35,866 --> 02:08:38,688
for an account opened in a
private bank in Vienna

1434
02:08:38,791 --> 02:08:45,305
into which Americans have recently
made payments of $250,000.

1435
02:08:45,964 --> 02:08:47,631
A lot of Money paid to a defector.

1436
02:08:48,085 --> 02:08:50,713
The account is in your and
your passport number.

1437
02:08:50,984 --> 02:08:53,237
- Oh,..I forgot my coat.
- I'll get it.

1438
02:08:55,457 --> 02:08:58,182
You recently made a trip
to Vienna, did you not?

1439
02:08:58,966 --> 02:09:02,229
You know, this is my niece's written.
She's angry with me.

1440
02:09:02,383 --> 02:09:05,079
This is one of the disks,
Boucher gave us.

1441
02:09:05,886 --> 02:09:08,248
The disks you passed on to the President

1442
02:09:08,346 --> 02:09:09,952
Your personal victory.

1443
02:09:11,715 --> 02:09:14,284
It suppose to come from the DOD.

1444
02:09:14,982 --> 02:09:18,291
But at the request of your niece,
we examined it more closely.

1445
02:09:20,983 --> 02:09:24,746
The encryption signature suggests
it was written in Langley.

1446
02:09:25,418 --> 02:09:26,493
It's a fake.

1447
02:09:29,348 --> 02:09:31,418
You are special. You have a gift like me.

1448
02:09:31,558 --> 02:09:34,755
You see through people.
You see them for what they really are.

1449
02:09:34,889 --> 02:09:37,334
And you always stay one step ahead.

1450
02:09:40,473 --> 02:09:42,400
Great family I have

1451
02:09:56,576 --> 02:09:58,304
you killed me.

1452
02:09:59,181 --> 02:10:01,034
Didn't I do well, uncle?

1453
02:10:21,251 --> 02:10:22,766
The target is in reach.

1454
02:12:24,732 --> 02:12:25,732
Hallo!

1455
02:12:28,869 --> 02:12:29,977
Hallo!

1456
